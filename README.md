# ScuffedKarlson2D
*Ah... this is where it all begins.*

The `legacy` version of **ScuffedKarlson2D** contains the original versions of most scripts and [PlayerPrefsEditor by BG Tools](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/playerprefs-editor-167903) that i accidentally included, even when i'm "removed" it though Github's web editor which also creates new commit instead of overwritting.

Like the current one, it was also re-licensed with The Unlicense so go nuts with it.
