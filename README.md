# ScuffedKarlson2D
This is a very unfinished, yet scuffed, version of Dani's Karlson 2D, re-licensed with The Unlicense. Originally published on 7th December 2020, as for the Unity version i used, unfortunately, i forgot to upload `ProjectSettings` folder which contains original configurations since, but thankfully i left-over `Library` folder that shouldn't be in that repo. where when i looked some log files, only to find out that it's `2019.4.12f1`, stupid 2020 exyxz, lol.

It contains some very old scripts, with some code refactor and attribution, so that it could be useful for both current and future projects.

If you want to play a original version of this game, Please visit a Dani's itch.io page [here](https://danidev.itch.io/karlson2d).
